# Doom-RPG-lite
Very lightweight and highly compatible Doom RPG mod.

This fork is an attempt to flesh out the several variants of this mod and work on their development. I'll be working to post a more detailed changelog/explanation of difference
between the various versions and add their respective files before doing much else.

The original version of this mod was made by Monkeybtm6, as posted in the following ZDoom forum thread: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=56272

A version 2.x revamp of the mod was later posted by Ixcuazl: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=56272&start=90#p1126215

A compatibility patch was added for the DoomRLA mod by Solid-Head: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=56272&start=105#p1138973

I have since updated Solid-Head's patch to improve handling of health pickups and also grant the stealth damage multiplier to DoomRLA's silenced weapons.
