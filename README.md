# Doom-RPG-lite
Very lightweight and highly compatible Doom RPG mod.

This fork is an attempt to flesh out the several variants of this mod and work on their development. I'll be working to post a more detailed changelog/explanation of difference
between the various versions and add their respective files before doing much else.

# Credits
The original version of this mod was made by Monkeybtm6, as posted in the following ZDoom forum thread: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=56272

A version 2.x revamp of the mod was later posted by Ixcuazl: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=56272&start=90#p1126215

A compatibility patch was added for the DoomRLA mod by Solid-Head: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=56272&start=105#p1138973

I have since updated Solid-Head's patch to improve handling of health pickups and also grant the stealth damage multiplier to DoomRLA's silenced weapons.

# Versions 
Legacy - The original 1.60 version of the mod, with patches
RPG-Lite - Current 2.x branch started by Ixcuazl
RPG-Lite-DoomRLA - DoomRLA-compatible version based off of the 2.x branch
RPG-Lite-Redux - Monkeybtm6's initial re-write of the Legacy branch

# Usage
If you want to play the mods as-is, you'll only need the respective *.pk3 files from this repository. The extracted folders are only for convenience if you want to make edits
